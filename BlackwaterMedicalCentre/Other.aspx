        Other Information

    <h3>
        Dispensing</h3>
    <p>
        Dispensing patients are able to obtain medication on prescription from the Prescription
        Department, where other services are available and our qualified staff are on site
        to assist you.  They can be contacted on 01621 855118, or alternatively, visit the pharmacy
        web site: <a href="http://www.blackwaterpharma.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.blackwaterpharma.co.uk</a>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Repeat Prescriptions</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>*</strong>PLEASE ALLOW AT LEAST TWO DAYS (excluding weekends and bank holidays)
        FOR THE REPEAT PRESCRIPTION TO BE GENERATED. ALLOW A FURTHER DAY IF YOU REQUIRE
        THE PRESCRIPTION TO BE DISPENSED.
        <br/>
        If you need a repeat prescription you will be given a repeat prescription slip to
        ensure accuracy. You can order your repeat prescription by telephoning our Repeat
        Prescription Order line on 01621 855118, <a href="mailto:prescriptionsF81099@nhs.net?Subject=Prescription request">
 emailing them</a>, or 
        by visiting the <a href="http://www.blackwaterpharma.co.uk/Email.aspx" target="_blank">pharmacy web site</a> & 
        filling out the prescription request: <a href="http://www.blackwaterpharma.co.uk/Email.aspx" target="blank">http://www.blackwaterpharma.co.uk/Email.aspx</a></p>
    <p>
        Your repeat prescription request slip provides a date when your medication review
        is due; you will need to make an appointment with a doctor/nurse practitioner/practice
        nurse.
        <br/>
        This is a safeguard to make sure you are taking the medicine properly and to allow
        for any changes, which may be necessary. This may seem inconvenient, but an annual
        review is necessary for the provision of good patient care.</p>
    <p>
        Prescriptions may be collected during dispensary hours only. Postal requests for
        repeat prescriptions (with SAE please) also require AT LEAST TWO DAYS' NOTICE, again
        excluding weekends and bank holidays.</p>
    <h3>
        Specimens</h3>
    <p>
        All specimens to go to the laboratory should be taken to the hospital by 2.30pm or, alternatively, they must be 
        with us at the surgery by 12pm.</p>
    <h3>
        Patients Under 16 Years Of Age</h3>
    <p>
        An adult should accompany all patients under 16 years of age.</p>
    <h3>
        Patient's Rights And Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>
        You have a right to expect a high standard of medical care from our practice and
        we will try at all times to provide the very best care possible within the resources
        available.</p>
    <p>
        We expect you to treat us in a courteous manner, keeping us up to date with any
        changes in your personal circumstances. Please refer to the Patient Contract.</p>
    <h3>
        <a name="1"></a>Patient Confidentiality and Data Protection</h3>
    <p>
        We ask you for personal information so that you can receive appropriate care and
        treatment. This information is recorded on computer and we are registered under
        the Data Protection Act. The practice will ensure that patient confidentiality is
        maintained at all times by all members of the practice team. However, for the effective
        functioning of a multi-disciplinary team, it is sometimes necessary that medical
        information about you is shared between members of the practice team.</p>
    <h3>
        <a name="3"></a>Comments</h3>
    <p>
        If you are not satisfied with the care you have received from the practice, please
        contact the assistant practice manager or business partner.</p>
    <h3>
        Zero Tolerance</h3>
    <p>
        We strongly support the NHS policy on zero tolerance. Anyone attending the surgery
        who abuses the GPs, staff or other patients be it verbally, physically or in any
        threatening manner whatsoever, will risk removal from the practice list. In extreme
        cases we may summon the police to remove offenders from the practice premises.</p>
