        The Staff</h2>
    <p>
        Our team includes receptionists, secretaries, dispensers and administrators who
        are trained to help you. The staff have a difficult task as they have to keep both
        doctors and patients happy! They keep the practice running smoothly whenever possible.
        Occasionally they may need to ask you for more details. Anything you tell them will
        always be treated in the strictest confidence, as they are bound by the same rules
        of confidentiality as the doctors. Please help them to help you.</p>
