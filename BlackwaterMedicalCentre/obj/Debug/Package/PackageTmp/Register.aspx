        This practice has a Patient Contract which all patients are required to sign. New
        patients who are on medication need to make an appointment to see a doctor for a
        medication review on registering.</p>

    <p>
        Registered patients 16 - 75 years old who have not been seen for three years may
        request a consultation. Also, registered patients aged over 75 years of age who
        have not been seen in the previous 12 months may request a consultation. If you
        are unable to attend the surgery for these appointments because of your medical
        condition a home visit may be arranged.</p>
