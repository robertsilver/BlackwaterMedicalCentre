        Patient Confidentiality And Data Protection
    </h3>
    <p>
        We ask you for personal information so that you can receive appropriate care and
        treatment. This information is recorded on computer and we are registered under
        the Data Protection Act. The practice will ensure that patient confidentiality is
        maintained at all times by all members of the practice team. However, for the effective
        functioning of a multi-disciplinary team it is sometimes necessary that medical
        information about you is shared between members of the practice team.
