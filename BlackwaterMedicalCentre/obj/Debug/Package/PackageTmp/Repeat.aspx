        <strong>HOW DO I....<br/>
            ...Obtain A Repeat Prescription?</strong></h2>
    <p>
        <strong>*</strong>PLEASE ALLOW AT LEAST TWO DAYS (excluding weekends and bank holidays)
        FOR THE REPEAT PRESCRIPTION TO BE GENERATED. ALLOW A FURTHER DAY IF YOU REQUIRE
        THE PRESCRIPTION TO BE DISPENSED.</p>
    <p>
        If you need a repeat prescription you will be given a repeat prescription slip to
        ensure accuracy. You can order your repeat prescription by telephoning our Repeat
        Prescription Order line on 01621 855118. This line is open between 08.00 and 18.30.

        Repeat prescriptions can be ordered via our <a href="http://www.blackwaterpharma.co.uk/Email.aspx" target="_blank">dedicated pharmacy website</a>

        Prescriptions can be handed in between 08.00 to 22.00.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your repeat prescription request slip provides a date when your medication review
        is due; you will need to make an appointment with a doctor/nurse practitioner/practice
        nurse. This is a safeguard to make sure that you are taking the medicine properly
        and to allow for any changes, which may be necessary. This may seem inconvenient,
        but an annual review is necessary for the provision of good patient care.</p>
    <p>
        Prescriptions may be collected during <a href="http://www.blackwaterpharma.co.uk/Opening.aspx" target="_blank">pharmacy opening hours only</a>. Postal requests for
        repeat prescriptions (with SAE please) also require AT LEAST TWO DAYS' NOTICE, again
        excluding weekends and bank holidays.</p>
    <p>
        A Medication Delivery Service is available for housebound patients Monday to Friday between 10.00 and 13.00 and 14.00 to 17.00
