    <h3>
        What is Patient Partner</h3>
    <p>
        This is a service designed for patients to make appointments anytime of day or night
        every day. You require a touch tone telephone.</p>
    <p>
        What the Practice needs to know?</p>
    <p>
        Your <strong>correct date of birth</strong> and your <strong>current telephone number</strong> from which you are
        likely to call the surgery.</p>
    <h3>
        How to operate it</h3>
    <p>
        You need to telephone the surgery in the same way as always using the 01621-876760
        number - you do not need to phone at 8am. It is far better to telephone before 8am.</p>
    <p>
        Listen carefully to the messages. The operator will tell you to press 1 for appointments.</p>
    <p>
        When you do this a second option will be given. This will be to press 1 for the
        automated service or 2 to speak to a receptionist.</p>
    <p>
        If you press 1 the system will ask for your date of birth. This needs to be inserted
        in the following way:<br />
        Example: <strong>01011972</strong> if you were born on the 1st January 1972</p>
    <p>
        It will then ask for your phone number<br />
        Example: <strong>842409*</strong></p>
    <p>
        Once the system has verified your details it will then give further options:<br />
        For Maldon Surgery press 1<br />
        For Heybridge Surgery press 2</p>
    <p>
        Press 1 to book an appointment<br />
        Press 2 to check, cancel or change an existing appointment</p>
    <p>
        Press 1 for the first available appointment with any doctor.</p>
    <p>
        Press 2 for a male doctor<br />
        Press 1 for any male doctor<br />
        Press 2 for Dr Roper<br />
        Press 3 for Dr Haeger<br />
        Press 4 for Dr Teatino<br />
        Press 5 for Dr Geranmayeh<br />
        Press 6 for Dr Wright</p>
    <p>
        Press 3 for a female doctor<br />
        Press 1 for any female doctor<br />
        Press 2 for Dr Cargill<br />
        Press 3 for Dr Lim</p>
    <p>
        When you have decided which doctor you wish to see, the system will find an available
        appointment for you.</p>
    <p>
        When you have decided on an appointment, press the 0 to accept it.</p>
